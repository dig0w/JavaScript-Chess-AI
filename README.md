<!-- ABOUT -->
## About The Project

After I've done a [Sudoku bot](https://github.com/dig0w/Sudoku-Bot), I've decided I wanted a bigger challenge in the same area, so I started developing this idea.
This project was built as a learning exercise in chess engine design and search optimization, which took around a month and a half, but there's still a lot I would love to add, and experiment.

I used Javascript for the whole thing, creating classes for the engine, the renderer, the AI, and some other small stuff.
This project uses a bunch of techniques to optimize performance like bitboards, zobrist hashes, etc... most of these were added after I completed the first stage of the project.

In the first stage I had made a fully working engine and AI, but it was too slow, so I tried remaking it for optimization, that's when I found the bitboards, and the zobrist hashes.
The stage two, didn't go very well, it was faster but the AI was worse, so I remade it again for a final time.
This new version, stage three, is now capable of doing evaluating roughly 11k nodes per second, this allowed for a much faster and possibly deeper AI.
